  s.description  = <<-DESC
Himotoki (紐解き) is a type-safe JSON decoding library purely written in Swift. This library is highly inspired by popular JSON parsing libraries in Swift: [Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo) and [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper).

_Himotoki_ has the same meaning of 'decoding' in Japanese.

- Just do JSON decoding (deserialization) well. JSON encoding (serialization) would not be supported going forward. :wink:
- Much simpler API.
- Fail-fast conditional model building. This is useful for some `struct`s with non-optional `let` properties.
- No external dependencies.
